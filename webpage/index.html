    <p>When they're not playing for their national teams, football players can play for club teams in their own
      countries or across the globe.</p>
    <p>Some domestic professional teams or leagues attract world class players from many other countries to play for
      them. Some national teams encourage (or require) their players to play their club football within their home
      country.</p>
    <p>This page shows where FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 players played their club football during the season before the
      World Cup. Check out the map below to visualize which countries' domestic leagues are most attractive to
      international players and which national team players mostly play in the same domestic league.</p>
